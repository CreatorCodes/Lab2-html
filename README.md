This project utilizes a fundamental layout based on HTML5 semantic elements, including `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`. It features a navigation bar for seamless access and a contact form that employs HTML5 validation to ensure accurate user input. Compliance with web standards has been verified using the W3C Validator.

Upon testing the `index.html` file through the W3C HTML Validator (validator.w3.org), initial errors and warnings were identified:
- Misplaced `<!DOCTYPE html>` – The document did not begin with a correct doctype declaration, leading to parsing errors.
- Missing `<title>` tag in `<head>` – Every HTML document must include a `<title>` element within `<head>`.
- Stray doctype declaration – The `<!DOCTYPE html>` was erroneously placed or duplicated.
- Unexpected `<html>` tag – The `<html>` element appeared in an invalid location, resulting in parsing issues.
- Missing section heading – A `<section>` element lacked a heading, which is essential for providing structure and context.
- Fatal error – Due to these structural problems, the validator could not continue processing other issues.

These problems were addressed, and the final validation confirmed that the HTML is now free from errors and warnings. All project files have been uploaded to GitHub via Git for easy access and collaboration.
